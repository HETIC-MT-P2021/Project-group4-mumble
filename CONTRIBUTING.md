Contributing
------------

If you want to contribute there are a few guidelines to follow so that we are able to process requests as efficiently as possible.

## How to contribute

    Submit the Individual Contributor License Agreement
    Make sure you have a GitHub account
    Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
    There are two templates at your disposal, with precise instructions on each one:
        Bug report
        Feature Request

    Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.
    Fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes

    Create a topic branch off of the Front, Back or Docker branches before you start your work.
        Please avoid working directly on the master branch or any of the Front or Back branches.

    Branches name must respect the following convention:
        front-featurename
        back-featurename
        docker-featurename

    Commits must respect the following convention:
        Feature/Commit name 
        Fix/Commit name
        Update/Commit name

    Write meaningful, descriptive commit messages.

## Submitting Changes

    Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
    Submit a pull request to the repository.
    We'll then give our feedback on the changes.
    Bug fixes or features that lack appropriate tests may not be considered for merge.
